    <h2>Steamed bread</h2>
    <p>Steam Bread, or dombolo, is a beloved staple in many African countries, particularly in Southern Africa. Unlike traditional baked bread, steam bread is cooked by steaming rather than baking, which gives it a distinctively soft, moist, and fluffy texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingidients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>480 g flour</li>
        <li>2 t yeast</li>
        <li>2 T sugar</li>
        <li>1 T salt</li>
        <li>2-2 1/2 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the Dough: Combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt, then add warm water (or milk) and mix until it forms a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead and Rise: Knead the dough until smooth, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, which usually takes about 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Prepare for Steaming: Grease a heat-safe container, like a metal or enamel bowl, and place the risen dough inside. Some people also wrap the dough in a cloth or plastic wrap to help maintain the shape and prevent moisture from entering.</li>
        <li>Steam the Bread: Place the container inside a larger pot with a few inches of boiling water, making sure the water doesnâ€™t reach the bread. Cover tightly and steam for about an hour to an hour and a half. The steam cooks the dough gently, resulting in a soft, spongy bread.</li>
        <li>Cool and Serve: Once done, carefully remove the container and allow the bread to cool slightly before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
